# 🔐 Trust-Based Secure Routing in MANET using Blockchain

This repository presents a hybrid solution combining **Blockchain-Enabled AODV Routing** with my research on **Dynamic Changing Trustability based Secured MANET Protocol (DCT-SMANET-P)**.

The aim is to strengthen security in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) using:
- Blockchain-based immutable ledger for routing records.
- Dynamic Trustability calculation for node selection.
- Simulation of Blackhole Attack scenario in AODV protocol.

## 📌 Project Summary

In MANETs, ensuring secure data transmission is extremely challenging due to:
- Lack of central authority
- High mobility of nodes
- Vulnerability to routing attacks

### ✅ Solution Approach

1️⃣ **Blockchain Integration (Project)**  
- Simulated in MATLAB.
- Blockchain maintains immutable routing records for verification.
- Prevents tampering even if attacks (e.g. blackhole) occur.

2️⃣ **Dynamic Trust Evaluation (Research Paper)**  
- Builds trust scores dynamically based on node behavior.
- Uses trust to select only reliable nodes for routing.
- Implemented & validated in NS3 simulation.
